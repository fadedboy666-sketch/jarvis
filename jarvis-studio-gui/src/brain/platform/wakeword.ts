// What IS certain from the code is that this listener had two ways to wedge
// permanently, both of which present exactly as "the wake word just stopped":
//   1. `handling` is set before an unbounded `await capture()`. getUserMedia
//      hanging (rather than rejecting) means the finally never runs, so
//      `handling` stays true, poll() early-returns forever, and the engine is
//      left stopped by onWake's own stop_wake_word.
//   2. a failed resume was swallowed by an empty catch, so nothing recovered and
//      nothing was reported.
// So rather than guess at the trigger, bound every wait and supervise the state:
// whatever wedges it, it un-wedges itself within HANDLING_MAX_MS and says so.
